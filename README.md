# bounce

This experiment lets you spawn a ball on a page by clicking anywhere.
The ball will then leave that position with a random direction and speed.
If it makes contact with the floor or walls it will bounce off them.
It attempts to simluate a real situation by adding a gravity constant - reducing the height of each bounce.

Extra interaction includes the following keyboard commands:
'd':          Removes last ball spawned
'backspace':  Removes all balls
'space':      Make the balls jump (once per bounce to stop continuous jumping)
